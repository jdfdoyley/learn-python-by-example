# Learn Python By Example

Start from basic level and move all the way up to professional references

**COMMENTS**
Comments are ignored by the Python compiler when your code is compiled. You can use comments to include non-executable text in your code, as a note or reminder to yourself.

**OPERATORS**
Operators are used to perform operations on values and variables. The Python operators are classified into seven different categories:

- Arithmetic operators: used to perform simple mathematical operations on
numeric values (except complex)
- Assignment operators: used to assign new values to variables
- Comparison operators: used to compare two values
- Logical operators: used to join two or more conditions
  - `and` - Returns True if both statements are true
  - `or` - Returns True if one of the statements is true
  - `not` - Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true
- Identity operators: used to check if two objects point to the same object,
with the same memory location
  - `is` - Returns true if both variables are the same object
  - `is not` - Returns true if both variables are not the same object
- Membership operators: used to check if a specific item is present in a
sequence (such as a string, tuple, list, or range) or a collection (such as a
dictionary, set, or frozen set)
  - `in` - Returns True if a value is present in the sequence
  - `not in` - Returns True if a value is not present in the sequence
