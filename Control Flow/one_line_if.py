# One Line if Statement
# Python allows us to write an entire if statement on one line.
x, y = 7, 5
if x > y: print('x is greater')

# Prints: x is greater

# You can even keep several lines of code on just one line, simply by
# separating them with a semicolon ;
x, y = 7, 5
if x > y: print('x is greater'); print('y is smaller'); print('x and y are not equal')

# Prints:
# x is greater
# y is smaller
# x and y are not equal
