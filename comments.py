# Single-line Comments

# This code prints "Hello, World!"
print('Hello, World!')

# Indent comments at the same level as the code immediately below them

# Initialize a function
def hello():
    # Print "Hello, World!" to the screen
    print('Hello, World!')

hello()

# Multiline/Block Comments
# Block comments don't technically exist in Python.
# However, there are two simple ways to create block comments.

# The First Way
# Add a # for each line
# Example
# Below code will print
# 'Hello, World!' to the screen
print('Hello, World!')

# The Second Way
# Wrapping your comments inside a set of triple quotes """ """
# This is technically not a comment. It's a bare stromg literal that is not
# assigned to any variable
"""Below code will print
'Hello, World!' to the screen"""
print('Hello, World!')
